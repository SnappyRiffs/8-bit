Custom syntax:
1st group is for importing modules
2nd group is for defining classes and function
3rd group is for data types (low and high is only used for bool and represents active low and active high)
4th group is for defining conditions
5th group is for defining what each parameter does

Functions:
must be defined as: `function <return type> name (param list)`

Statements:
must end with `;`

General:
all variables and arrays must be of bool type unless implementing the runner module. This means that unless using an actual number, int should not be used.
